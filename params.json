The method includes, in response to determining that a number of users in a wireless network exceed a threshold number, allotting the users into k block. The value of k is at least two. For each block, the method performs determining residual information for the block. The method also includes, for each block of the k blocks, loading into a fast-access memory user data for users in the block and scheduling the block in a scheduling period based at least in part on the user data and the residual information for k−1 other blocks.\r\n\r\n##### [Block processing techniques to scale scheduler operation in Cellular Systems: A case study for 3G networks](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/6fKjv3pmyII3zc)\r\n`TAIST Tokyo Tech Program, National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA)` `January 25, 2013`\r\n\r\n* While the capabilities of modern cellular systems are being rapidly enhanced by standards groups such as 3GPP LTE and IEEE 802.16, the limiting factor in performance has shifted to platform constraints such as processing load and memory. In this paper we investigate techniques to overcome these limitations and to achieve the theoretical predictions of system capacity. In particular we focus on the scalability of scheduler operation in High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA) systems. HSUPA is fast becoming the technology of choice for both operators and end-users with wide-spread deployments. However, scaling the capacity of HSUPA systems without significant hardware upgrades remains a difficult proposition. In this work we propose a novel method to enhance cellular capacity manifold without disruption to Quality-of-Service (QoS).\r\n\r\n### Skills\r\n`C`, `OOP`, `Functional Programming`, `Shell Scripting`, `Database`, `WordPress`, `Android`, `Information Security`, `Cryptography`, `Linux`, `C++`, `Java`, `PHP`, `Python`, `SML/NJ`, `MySQL`, `MySQL`, `Git`, `Eclipse`, \r\n\r\n","google":"UA-59542024-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
